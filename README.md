# Barracuda-PoseNet

Using Unity 2019.1.0b8

Getting 30-50FPS on a Macbook Pro Mid2015 Intel Core i7, 16GB memory DDR3

I got to this point with major help from these repos and alot of code here is re-used or based on theirs;-
  - https://github.com/keijiro/AsyncCaptureTest.git
  - https://github.com/infocom-tpo/PoseNet-Unity.git
  - https://github.com/rwightman/posenet-python.git
  
  
I feel like the code and performance could be made so much better, I began trying to see if I can make use of Unity's new ECS system but it's my first time experiementing with parallel jobs and could not get it to work with what I know. I'll update as I learn more about using custom jobs and Barracuda as there isn't alot of information on the topic out there.
Contribs/Help suggested and appreciated!
